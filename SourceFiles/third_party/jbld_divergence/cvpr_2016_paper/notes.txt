- Kinect dataset
 228 * 228 matrices <-- too small

- MSRAction3D
Can be boosted up to:
	684*684 <-- Is there still potential for speedup?

Files of interest:

	'analyzedata.m' for running comparison of methods
	--> we can focus on the plain method with the 'nugget' - it seems to take long enough for our method to show a speedup. I've commented out the others for now. I think it's also possible to get a plot with interpolated values out of it.
	--> cholesky operations being carried out in 'loglikfast.m' - we can probably swap in our code here

 	'logdet.m'
 	--> Cholesky is being carried out here
 	'JBLD.m'
 	--> Implementation of divergence metric formula

 	To execute:
 	skeletal_action_classification(3) -->  set 'opt.H_rows = 5' to 12 for largest matrix
