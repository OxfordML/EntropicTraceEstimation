# EntropicTraceEstimation

This repo is to accompaigne the paper "Entropic Trace Estimates for Log Determinants", which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07223). The work is a part of an on going collaboration between the MLRG at Oxford (UK) and the Department of Data Science at Eurecom (France).

Currently the code is only the main parts used on the paper. However, over the coming weeks we aim to have some easy to full worked demos.

For any queries related to the code please do not heitate to contact the authors.
